# !/bin/bash/

### syntax rules
1. when defining a variable whitespaces must be eliminated
2. include the shell in all the scripts at the beginning of the file (#!/bin/bash)

3. $var is used to print the value of the variable
4.  $(command) is used to execute a command
5.  $((expression)) this format is used to perform math operations and it returns the value at the end
6.  ((expression)) performs math operation but doesn't return the value
